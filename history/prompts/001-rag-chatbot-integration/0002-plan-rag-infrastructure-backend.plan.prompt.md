# Plan RAG Infrastructure Backend

## User Input (PROMPT_TEXT)
```
--title "Plan RAG Infrastructure Backend" --stage plan
```

## Assistant Response (RESPONSE_TEXT)
Created a comprehensive implementation plan for the backend RAG infrastructure, including architecture, implementation steps, technical specifications, and quality assurance measures.

## Work Completed (OUTCOME_IMPACT)
Successfully created a detailed implementation plan for the backend RAG infrastructure that covers all technical requirements including API endpoints, data flow, security considerations, and quality measures.

## Files Modified (FILES_SUMMARY)
- specs/001-rag-chatbot-integration/plan.md: Complete implementation plan for RAG infrastructure
- specs/001-rag-chatbot-integration/checklists/plan.md: Quality validation checklist for the plan

## Tests Conducted (TESTS_SUMMARY)
None - planning and documentation only

## Next Steps (NEXT_PROMPTS)
- /sp.tasks to break down implementation tasks
- Begin implementation of backend components

## Reflection (REFLECTION_NOTE)
The plan provides a solid architectural foundation for implementing the RAG system with proper security measures, error handling, and quality controls to prevent hallucinations.
