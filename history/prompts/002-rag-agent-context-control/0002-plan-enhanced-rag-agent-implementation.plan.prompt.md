# Plan Enhanced RAG Agent Implementation

## User Input (PROMPT_TEXT)
```
--title "Plan Enhanced RAG Agent Implementation" --stage plan
```

## Assistant Response (RESPONSE_TEXT)
Created a comprehensive implementation plan for the enhanced RAG agent with context control, detailing API changes, agent logic updates, and quality assurance measures.

## Work Completed (OUTCOME_IMPACT)
Successfully created a detailed implementation plan for enhancing the RAG agent to support both full-book context and user-selected text context for answering questions.

## Files Modified (FILES_SUMMARY)
- specs/002-rag-agent-context-control/plan.md: Complete implementation plan for enhanced RAG agent
- specs/002-rag-agent-context-control/checklists/plan.md: Quality validation checklist for the plan

## Tests Conducted (TESTS_SUMMARY)
None - planning and documentation only

## Next Steps (NEXT_PROMPTS)
- /sp.tasks to break down implementation tasks
- Begin implementation of enhanced RAG agent features

## Reflection (REFLECTION_NOTE)
The plan provides a clear roadmap for implementing context control in the RAG system while maintaining existing functionality and quality standards.
