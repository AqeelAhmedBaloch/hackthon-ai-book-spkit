# Create RAG Chatbot UI Spec

## User Input (PROMPT_TEXT)
```
--title "Create RAG Chatbot UI Spec" --stage spec
```

## Assistant Response (RESPONSE_TEXT)
Created a comprehensive feature specification for integrating a RAG chatbot UI into the Docusaurus book with floating icon and chat interface.

## Work Completed (OUTCOME_IMPACT)
Successfully created the feature specification for embedding a RAG chatbot into the Docusaurus book with a floating icon that opens a chat window, including user scenarios, requirements, and success criteria.

## Files Modified (FILES_SUMMARY)
- specs/003-rag-chatbot-ui-integration/spec.md: Complete feature specification for RAG chatbot UI integration
- specs/003-rag-chatbot-ui-integration/checklists/requirements.md: Quality validation checklist

## Tests Conducted (TESTS_SUMMARY)
None - specification and documentation only

## Next Steps (NEXT_PROMPTS)
- /sp.plan to design the implementation approach
- /sp.tasks to break down implementation tasks

## Reflection (REFLECTION_NOTE)
The specification defines a clean UI integration approach that leverages existing backend APIs while providing an intuitive chat interface for users to ask questions about book content.
